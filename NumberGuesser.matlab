This is an Octave/MATLAB program.

NumberGuesser.matlab

A program that guesses a players number.
A player guesses a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.
If the computer's guess is too high, the user should enter H.
If the computer's guess is too low, the user should enter L.

Otherwise, the user should enter E.
